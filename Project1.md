# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software. 
In this project i was able to successful Create my EC2 instance using my AWS cloud, set it running, Connect to my instance, install my Apache2,Mysql and php.
Will share images.
NB Because this is my first project and i had already done the project before watching the video on how to submit my projects i will basically be sharing images. Also note that all commands were ran and there was no blocker and i also shared completed screen shot on slack.
